Why python?
-shallow learning curve
-transparent syntax and semantics 
- good  string-handling functionality.
-As an interpreted language,Python facilitates interactive exploration. 
-As an object-oriented language, Python permits data and methods to be encapsulated and re-used easily. 
-As a dynamic language,Python permits attributes to be added to objects on the fly, and permits variables to be
typed dynamically, facilitating rapid development.
-Python comes with an extensive standard library, including components for graphical programming, numerical pro-
cessing, and web connectivity.
 So in a nutshell Python is heavily used in industry, scientific research, and education around the world.
Python  is  often  praised  for  the  way  it  facilitates  productivity,  quality,  and  main-
tainability of software. Please reffer a sample of Python success sotries at http://www.python.org/about/success/

Define : NLTK
NLTK defines an infrastructure that can be used to build NLP programs in Python. It provides basic classes for representing 
data relevant to natural language processing; standard interfaces for performing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, 
syntactic parsing, and text classification;and standard implementations for each task that can be combined to solve complex problems.
NLTK comes with extensive documentation. Apart from the basic examples provided in the lectures covering all topics
The website at http://www.nltk.org/  provides API documentation that covers every module, class, and
function in the toolkit, specifying parameters and giving examples of usage. The website also provides many HOWTOs with extensive examples and test cases, intended for
users, developers, and instructors.
