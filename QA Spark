1) What are the top features of Spark that interests you
  Ans : 
    Spark provides advanced analytic options like graph algorithms, machine learning, streaming data, etc
    It has built-in APIs in multiple languages like Java, Scala, Python and R
    It has good performance gains, as it helps run an application in the Hadoop cluster ten times faster on disk and 100 times faster in memory.
2) How Spark uses Hadoop 
Ans: Spark has built in cluster management solution , it uses Hadoop for storage
3) Define the various data sources available in SparkSQL
ans: Parquet file: Parquet file is a columnar format file that helps –

    Limit I/O operations
    Consumes less space
    Fetches only required columns.
 JSON data set and Hive tables
4)what is developer dilemma with Spark applications?
Ans: Hitting the web service several times by using multiple clusters.
Run everything on the local node instead of distributing it.
Beware :  Spark makes use of memory for processing.
5)How do you compare Hadoop and Spark?
Ans: Hadoop MapReduce requires programming in Java which is difficult, 
though Pig and Hive make it considerably easier. 
Learning Pig and Hive syntax takes time. 
Spark has interactive APIs for different languages like Java, Python or Scala 
and includes Shark [Spark SQL for SQL lovers - making it comparatively easier to use than Hadoop.]
6) What is BlinkDB and where itis used?
Ans:BlinkDB is a query engine for executing interactive SQL queries on huge volumes of data
and renders query results marked with meaningful error bars. 
BlinkDB helps users balance ‘query accuracy’ with response time.

7)What is Tachyon? it is a Spark library for reliable file sharing at memory speed across different cluster frameworks
